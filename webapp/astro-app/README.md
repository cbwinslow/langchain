# Astro Data Webapp

This example web application demonstrates how to combine **Astro**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS** to build a professional dashboard for LangChain data analysis.

It contains placeholder components for:

- A spreadsheet-like interface
- SQL database viewer
- SQL query writer
- Script toolkit for scraping bulk data
- User profile and database configuration settings

The app is intended to run behind an OAuth gateway and can be served from a subdomain such as `lang.cloudcurio.cc`.

To develop locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
